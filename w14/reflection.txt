Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
When I first realized the power of functions when I was working on a class assignment,
this assignment required us to called function in other places in the document or directory.
Another time that I learned is that we can create nested functions, functions also help to make 
codes a lot cleaner and more organized and make your code reusable since it can be called several places.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
A test function can help ensure your code is working correctly, it is a way to pretest your code
before it goes out to production or deployment. It is also a good way where you can find bugs and 
make fixes for these bugs and is best practice to keep your code clean since several tests can be 
run against the code. 


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
I had learned the build-in debug method in class for VS studio, however, I personally find that
making simple logs can be just as fast and help you see the values your code is returning. As I remembered 
a time when we had to debug one of our group assignments, I did this, and it greatly helped me narrow down 
the problem. I was able to find the issue and correct it accordingly by checking the log values to ensure 
they returned the expected results.
